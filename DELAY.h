            - Use "HWREG" to change register value (more info in HW_type.h)
 * Input: No
 * Output: No
 * Change this function:
            + Change the Load value to create different time delay interval
            + Change the interrupt handler by "SystickIntRegister" function

 * The SYSTICK timer automatically load value from RELOAD_R so there no need to update new value

 * After 100ms: Execute monitor to indicate system state

 * Function: Delay micro second corresponding to "microseconds"

          - unsigned char "Number": the Timeout block use because more than one Timeout can be used at a time
 * Output: 1 if enough time in loop
 * Change: Change time in loop, change the Number to using more Timeout block, then must add more code in Systick_ISR
and the definition of 2 arrays using in code bellow because the code is using just 5 Timeout block
 * Affect global variable:
          1. "Timeout_active"
          2. "Tick_timeout"
